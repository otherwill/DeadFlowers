Since there aren't any online set lists from '65-'71, here's a
sparse collection to start to fill in the gap.

These set lists are taken from my tapes so they may not be completely
accurate.  They may be missing a few songs that aren't on a tape
or parts of them may be out of order or some set breaks may be
wrong or missing and they certainly don't cover ever pre-'72 show
(I wish!).  But, at least all of the dates should be correct and
there are a few places where I know these lists are right even if
they don't agree with Deadbase.

Even though the lists are so sparse, they do cover most of the
"classic shows for tape collectors" in the FAQ so hopefully they
will at least be helpful to new tape collectors (and anyone desperate
for any online setlists from this period).
