COMMENTS by Susan Green/Burlington Free Press 10/2000: In 1965 Phil Lesh decided to
take a year off from his academic pursuits at Mills College. He'd been majoring in
avant-garde composition after a childhood spent playing classical violin and trumpet.
"I would have gone back and probably studied conducting, but then I met this guy
named Garcia," he recalls.

That fortuitous encounter with folk guitarist/vocalist Jerry Garcia brought the 25
year-old Lesh into a group that included keyboard player Ron "Pigpen" McKernan,
rhythm guitarist Bob Weir, and drummer Bill Kreutzmann. The Warlocks were born,
initially cranking out amplified rock standards at a time when acoustic was all the
rage.

As they began to take more and more original approach with lyricist Robert Hunter
collaborating on many songs, The Warlocks changed names.  Good thing. Warlockheads
doesn't roll off the tongue with quite the same ease as Deadheads.

The Dead hooked up with author Ken Kesey and his legendary Merry Pranksters, an
assortment of pleasure-seeking bohemians immortalized in Tom Wolfe's 1968 book, "The
Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test." This association represented a new chapter for the
musicians who were smoking copious amounts of marijuana, taking LSD and performing at
the outdoor Trips Festivals in the Bay Area.  The Dead assumed a prominent place in
the vanguard of the nascent hippie movement with San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury
district as ground zero.

Although it was a time of unparalleled experimentation with drugs and
lifestyles, the band never slacked off.  "We worked hard, " Lesh says.  "In those
first five years, we played for hours at a time every day, rehearsing or just
jamming."

Lesh's sensibility helped convince the others that "we could go beyond the
three-minute song by improvising in a way that looked to jazz."

The Dead soon became known for long, winding meditations on its own tunes or those
the band admired written by others.  With what one critic described as "extraordinary
bursts of imagination," the sound was electric and never repetitive.

"We liked to play for dancers," Lesh says.  "That's how we got the highest level of
feedback from audiences.  At one Trips Festival. I looked out at 5,000 people dancing
in waves, forgetting themselves in our music."

The excitement of live Dead did not translate to the group's albums.  "We were never
really good, frankly, at recording.  That was always secondary to us."

High Times 12/2000 by Paul Krassner:
Garcia originally started smoking pot in his early teens. He loved to get stoned with
his friends and go to a drive-in movie. In those days you could get a matchbox of
marijuana, fifteen skinny joints' worth, for as little as $5.

         It was not surprising, years later, that one could find a
         kilo of Acapulco Gold in the kitchen of the Dead house in
         San Francisco.

         "Jerry taught me how to roll joints," recalls Steve Parish.
         "He was a great joint roller. He liked seeded weed best. He
         thought weed went downhill when everybody did sensimilla."

         Garcia used to tease Dead songwriter Robert Hunter by
         threatening to leave a big pile of joints in the middle of
         the dining-room table for Hunter's parents to find. Hunter
         later became a participant in the Veterans Administration
         program of experimentation with psychedelic drugs, and Jerry
         pumped him for information about LSD. And, in 1965, with
         David Nelson and Sara Rupenthal, who became his first wife,
         Jerry took his first acid trip...but certainly not his last.

         "We had enough acid to blow the world apart," he would tell
         Robert Greenfield, author of Dark Star, "We were just
         musicians in this house and we were guinea-pigging more or
         less continuously. Tripping frequently if not constantly.
         That got good and weird."

         It was while tripping on acid that Garcia listened to the
         Beatles and to Bob Dylan's first electric album, destroying
         in the process Garcia's prejudice against amplified music,
         and so, with his band, the Warlocks, forerunner to the
         Grateful Dead, Jerry gleefully turned his talent from
         bluegrass banjo-picking to rocking with an electric guitar.

This doesn't seem consistent with Phil's own comments to Michael Lydon in an article

of The Warlocks and opening the carreer of a new group called "San Francisco's

-- March 1972 Playboy Interview by Ed McClanahan (reprinted without permission):
SCENE: The Dead's business office in San Rafael, where Bob Hunter, the Dead's
lyricist, has just been telling everybody about a friend recently returned from a
trip to Cuba.  Enter Ramrod, one of the band's equipment handlers.

RAMROD: Now the first time *I* ever saw Jerry Garcia was in midwinter 1965, in Ken
Kesey's house up in La Honda.  I'm lounging around Kesey's living room, see, and
this extraordinarily curious looking party comes shuffling through.  In point of
fact, he's the very first true freak I've ever laid eyes on, this somewhat
rotund young man with a hairdo like a dust mop dipped in coal tar, and after
he's gone Kesey says that was Jerry Garcia, he's got a rock'n'roll band that's
gonna play with us this Saturday night at the San Jose Acid Test, their name is
the Warlocks but they're gonna change it to the Grateful Dead.

At the time, to tell the truth, I wasn't exactly galvanized with excitement by
this bit of news; after all, only a few Saturday nights before that I'd attended
what I've since some to regard as the Olde *Original* Acid Test, a curiously
disjointed but otherwise perfectly ordinary party at Kesey's house featuring
nothing more startling than an abundance of dope and a drunken Berkeley poet who
kept loudly reciting Dylan Thomas and, at midnight (hours after I'd gone home,
adept as ever at missing the main event), the ritual sacrifice and subsequent
immolation of a chicken.

But what I didn't know then was that 400 people would turn up for the San Jose
Acid Test, which begat the Palo Alto Acid Test, which begat the Fillmore Acid
Test, which begat the Trips Festival, which begat Bill Graham, who (to hear
*him* tell it, anyhow) begat Life As We Know It Today.  Still, like I said, I
couldn't possibly have known that at the time.

||||On The Town||||
Lesson for the S.F. in The Mime Benefit
||||by Ralph J. Gleason||||
The benefit for the San Francisco Mime Troupe Friday night at the Fillmore Auditorium
(it was billed as "Appeal II, for Continued Artistic Freedom in the Arts") was a
roaring success. Over 3500 people paid $1.50 apiece to be there.
But it was a great deal more than a benefit. It was substantiation of the suspicion
that the need to dance on the part of a great number of residents of this area is so
great it simply must be permitted.
The Friday night affair was basically a rock 'n roll dance such as the ones the
Family Dog put on at the Longshore Hall.
If this city was run for the citizens, such affairs would be commonplace and
conducted say, once a month at the Civic Auditorium where there used to be numerous
dances during the swing era.
* * *
At 9:30 there was a double line a block long outside the Fillmore Auditorium. At 1
a.m. it was still there, the individuals were new but the packed house still existed.
Inside a most remarkable assembladge of humanity was leaping, jumping, dancing,
frigging, fragging and frugging on the dance floor to the music of the half dozen
rock bands--The Mystery Trend, The Great Society, The Jefferson Airplane, the VIP's,
The Gentlemen's Band, The Warlocks and others. The costumes were freeform
Goodwill-cum-Sherwood Forest. Slim young ladies with their faces painted a la
Harper's Bazzar in cats-and-dogs lines, granny dresses topped with hugh feathers,
white hats with decals of mystic design; bell-bottoms split up the side! The
combinations were seemingly limitless.
At each end of the huge hall was a three foot high sign saying LOVE. Over the bar was
another saying "No Booze", while the volunteer bartenders served soft drinks.
Alongside the regular bar was a series of tables selling apples! The only dance
(outside of Halloween) I've ever been at where they sold apples, Craaaazy! In a
corner past the apple table was a baby in a carriage, sound asleep with a bottle and
a teddy bear clutched in his (her?) arms.
This crowd was so far out that when Milton Hunt, the distinguished North Beach
boulevardier, entered wearing a scrape and a black sombrero and escorting a girl
dressed in a Vikki Duggins skirt (cut six inches below the hipline and supported by a
thin net top and that's all!) no one turned a hair. It was that kind of a night.
Although it was a benefit for the Mime Troupe in its fight against "the law's delay,
the insolence of office" to which their handest refers in Shakesphearean terms, there
were thousands there who never heard of the Mime Troupe or at least never had been in
one of their shows, as Ronnie Davis pointed out.
They were there for a multitude of reasons, and the reasons bear examination. Some
were there because the Mime Troupe represents, along with Jerry Ets Hotkins, a battle
for creativity in the arts. Others, and more I suspect, were there because the Mime
Troupe's park use hassle dramatizes another aspect of the struggle of US against
THEM.
Still others were there as part of the rock revolution. They don't. need booze (as
the swing era dancers did). All they need is the sound of the guitars. They get high
on decibels alone. And they are hurting to dance.
* * *
SAN FRANCISCO has been hell on dances for years. The police obviously regard mass
proximity of the sexes to the sound of music as a hazard equal to a time bomb. But I
suspect this attitude will have to be tempered. The actual demand for dances is going
to increase. The whole rock revolution points to dancing, the music ineluctably moves
one to move.
Another thing about the Friday night revel. There were no guards inside. There was an
absence of uniforms and there was no trouble. It was the kind of crowd were over a
dozen people stopped dancing, got down on thier hands and knees to help a girl find a
contact lens that had popped out during a particularly dramatic movement. They
scrambled on the dance floor for a few minutes and found it. She cleaned it in her
mouth, popped it back in and the dancing continued.
Don't knock the rock, as the British used to say.--Ralph J. Gleason (S.F. Chronicle,
12/13/65).

There were two "Acid Tests" which I didn't go to after my "initiation" at the Dec 11
Muir Beach event, one was in Palo Alto and the other one was in Portland. There were
two before that also.

-- March 1972 Playboy Interview by Ed McClanahan (reprinted without permission):
Anyhow, I didn't go to the San Jose Acid Test.  But a few Saturday nights later
I did make it over to a ratty old night club called Ben's Big Beat, in the mud
flats beside the Bayshore Freeway for the Palo Alto Acid Test; and the what's-
their-names, the Grateful Dead, they were there, too, Jerry Garcia plucking
strange sonic atonalities out of his Magic Twanger, backed up by a pair of
cherubic-looking boys named Phil Lesh, on bass guitar, and Bobby Weir, on rhythm
guitar, and a drummer -- Bill Kreutzmann -- who looked so young and innocent and
fresh-faced that one's first impulse was to wonder how he got his momma to let
him stay out so late, and, mainly, this incredibly gross person who played
electric organ and harmonica and sang occasional blues vocals.

Pigpen, someone said his name was -- beyond a doubt the most marvelously ill-favored
figure to
grace a public platform since King Kong came down with stagefright and copped out on
the Bruce Cabot show.  He was bearded and burly and barrel chested, jowly and scowly
and growly, and he had long, Medusalike hair so greasy it might have been groomed
with Valvoline, and his angry countenance glowered out through it like a wolf at bay
in a hummock of some strange, rank foliage.  He wore, as I recall, a motorcyclist's
cap, crimped and crumpled Hell's Angel style, and heavy iron-black boots, and the gap
between the top of his oily Levis and the bottom of his tattletale-gray T-shirt
exposed a half-moon of a distended beer belly as pale and befurred as a wedge of
moldy jack cheese.

Sitting up there at that little spindly-legged organ, he looked enormous, bigger than
life, like a gorilla at a harpsichord.  But the ugly mother sure could *play*!  To
one as dull of ears as I, who'd always pretty much assumed that the only fit place
for organ music outside of church was the roller rink, those ham-fisted whorehouse
chords he was hammering out seemed in and of themselves to constitute the most
satisfying sort of blasphemy.  And sing!  The way this coarse-voiced ogre snarled his
unintelligible yet unfathomably indecent talkin'-blues phrases would curl the very
Devil's codpiece; fathers of teenage daughters must have shuddered in their sleep as
far away as Burlingame that night. Verily, he was wondrous gross, was this Pigpen;
yet such was the subtle alchemy of his art that the more he profaned love and beauty,
the more his grossness rendered him beautiful.

"Far *out*!" the teeny-boppers and their boyfriends in Ben's Beat kept exclaiming
while Pig worked. "Isn't he far f*ckin' *out*!"  It was an expression I'd not run
into before, but even at first hearing it seemed destined, if only for its sommodious
inexactness, to be with us for a good long while. In any case, it accommodated Pigpen
very nicely;  he was indeed one far-out gentelman, no doubt about it, none at all.

(See 1/15/66 - "Portland Acid Test" for more of Bear's comments). His comments were
made off the top of his head & therefore may not be accurate.
Owsley "Bear" Stanley:
There were only two Matrix shows, one in Dec '65, and the one before the Fillmore AT.
The Matrix was a crummy little closet of a venue with barely enough room for 50 to 60
people to stand in, the big name bands didn't play there after they got up and known.
The hall couldn't pay more than $100 for the act. They seldom had two acts/night and
so far as I know never three. The Dead played there twice when they were unknown.

-- Owsley "Bear" Stanley:
Portland acid test was either on Dec 18 '65, or Jan 15 '66. There were two which I
didn't go to after my "initiation" at the Dec 11 Muir Beach event, one was in Palo
Alto and the other one was in Portland. There were two before that also. Only one
other one did I miss, the first one in LA in late Feb in Northridge. So I missed a
total of five of the AT's. The Dead were always the centerpiece of the Acid Tests,
the real reason for its existence, and it could not have taken place without them.
The band at the time rated their participation above any other activity in
importance.
Owsley later goes on to say:

I met the Dead formally at the Fillmore show on 11 Feb '66. The Northridge Acid Test
was 19 Feb, the Sunset Blvd. test was 25 Feb. I was not at the Northridge Test. Watts
was in March.
