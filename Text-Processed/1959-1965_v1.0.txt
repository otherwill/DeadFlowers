                      ===================================
                      The Prehistory Of The Grateful Dead
                           [ - and related music - ]
                      ===================================
                        Tapes In Circulation, 1959-1965

                         version 1.0 - 8 February 1996


I am attempting to compile a list of all known tapes of pre-Grateful Dead
material by the members of the Grateful Dead and their extended musical
family. This early draft is based on tapes from my own collection and I do
not presume it to be complete. As this list becomes more complete it will
include such information as cut, edited and missing songs, as well as
precise timings for all songs and shows.

I need help in continuing this project. It is very likely that there are
factual errors here, and many of the song titles here are best guesses and
are very likely incorrect. If you can contibute information about
additional tapes, or can correct some of the information here, please let
me know. My email address is jeff@tiedrich.com.

This document, as well as future drafts, can be found at

Thank you.

           Audience recording (or from mics placed on stage)

           The Tangent, Palo Alto, CA. Approximately 10 minutes.
           Audience recording (or from mics placed on stage).
I'm Satisfied, The Rub. Circulating tapes of these two songs are from an FM
broadcast of an audio documentary on the Grateful Dead produced by Michael
Wanger and Vance Frost for Golden State Recorders sometime in late 1968 or
early 1969. This 120-minute program also includes some early Grateful Dead
live recordings, but as far as I can tell, no live Warlocks material.


??/??/64   Jorma Kaukonen, solo acoustic guitar
           Cabala Coffee House, Berkeley, CA. Approximately 45 minutes.
           Soundboard recording?
Great Change, Drinking Gourd, Uncle Sam, Candyman, Dancin', Pawnshop Blues,
Down And Out, Let Us Get Together, Never Happen No More, Trouble In Mind


??/??/64   Jorma Kaukonen, solo acoustic guitar
           The Tangent, Palo Alto, CA. Approximately 10 minutes.
           Audience recording (or from mics placed on stage).
Sweet Georgia Brown, Diamond Ring Blues (the latter with Pigpen playing
harmonica). This tape also makes the rounds labeled "Jorma teaches Pigpen
to play guitar."


??/??/65   Jorma Kaukonen and Janis Joplin
           unknown location, San Francisco, CA. Approximately 20 minutes.
"The Typewriter Tapes"


11/03/65   The Warlocks (Garcia, Lesh, Pigpen, Kreutzmann, Weir). Golden Gate
           Studios, San Francisco. Approximately 35 minutes. Studio recording
           session for Autumn Records' "The Emergency Crew."
Can't Come Down, Mindbender (also known as Confusion Prince), The Only Time
Is Now, Caution, I Know You Rider, Early Morning Rain


Other Warlocks Material: none that I can determine are legitimate. Tapes
labeled "Muir Beach Acid Test 12/18/65" (techincally a Grateful Dead
appearance) have turned out to be the material we call 5/5/67. The "More
Power Rap" tape that is generally dated 10/?/66 has also been given various
1965 misdates. Same for the soundtrack to the Kesey Acid Test Video
soundtrack (though -some- of that might just be from 1965). There is a tape
of "Can't Come Down" from a mid-sixties KSAN-FM broadcast called "The Bill
Graham Weekend" which to my ears sounds like version from the 11/3/65
studio session with "crowd noise" mixed in.
