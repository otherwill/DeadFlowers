What is this project?
---------------------

This is a project to set up an analytic database of Grateful Dead songs, shows, and eventually lyrics.

And, then to play around with various tools.

Why?
----

* Teach myself Ruby
* Sharpen R skills
* Do something with GitHub
* Listen to some Dead

Text Analysis!  Graph Databases! TwitterBots! Net Analysis!

Notes
-----

Yes, I am learning.  And committed the sin of hand edits.  And am writing some bad code.
